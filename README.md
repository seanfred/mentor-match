Mentor Match App v1.0

About
The Mentor Match Application was created for use to link CodeFellows Students with Seattle Tech Industry Professionals to gain career advice and expand their network in the programming world.

This application was created using Ruby on Rails, [other tools go here]. There are 3 intended users of this tool: the Student, the Mentor and the Admin. 

The Student User can:
* Submit a survey of questions about themselves, their career experience and aspirations and their mentorship goals.
* Submit a Follow-up mentor program survey once the course is officially complete

The Mentor User can:
* Create a profile of their career experience
* Review anonymous student surveys (hiding student names)

The Admin User can:
* Review the full mentor profile
* Review the full student survey
* Pair the students and mentors
* Send notifications to students and mentors about matching process


Mentor Match App was originally created by Anthony Zullo and Stephanie Hekker, Code Fellows 2013
